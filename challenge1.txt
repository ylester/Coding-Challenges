You are going to receive "n" payments in the upcoming month. The payments are numbered from 0 to (n-1) and pi denotes the amount of money in dollars that will be paid in connection with the i-th payment. Before receiving the payments, you have two banking options to consider:

1.You can receive all the payments on your current bank account remembering that the bank charges you for each payment i max(k,x% of pi), where k and x are given.

2. You can pay the bank "d" dollars upfront to open a new special account for which the bank doesn't charge you for any of the upcoming transactions.

Your task is to decide which of the above two options is more profitable to you. If both ways are equally profitable, then you prefer to be charged for each transaction.
