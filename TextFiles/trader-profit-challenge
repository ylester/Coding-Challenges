Mike is a stock trader and makes a profit by buying and selling stocks. 
He buys a stock at a lower price and sells it at a higher price to book a profit. 
He has come to know the stock prices of a particular stock for "n" upcoming days in future 
and wants to calculate the maximum profit by doing the right transactions 
(single transaction = buying + selling). 


Can you help him maximize his profit?

The stock prices are given in the form of an array 'A' for 'n' days.
Given the stock prices and a positive integer 'k' , find and print the maximum profit Mike 
can make in at most 'k' transactions.
